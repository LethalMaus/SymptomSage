## Introduction

Track your symptoms over time, like a wise old age would.

Add a symptom like 'coughing' by date and severity and add a description such as 'chesty and dry'.

Search for when you last had a specific symptom, to ensure no trends are building or to react accordingly when one is.

## Features

- Add symptom, date, severity and description
- See all symptoms over time
- Search for a specific symptom
